--The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.

What are libraries?

-A library is a collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform specific tasks.
-Libraries are often used to reduce the amount of code a programmer needs to write by providing reusable functions or classes that can be called upon as needed.
-All libraries are shared into two classifications. All libraries are either Static or Dynamic.
